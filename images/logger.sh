#!/usr/bin/env bash
# We are not using `set -Eeuo pipefail` here because this file is sourced by
# other scripts that might not be ready for a strict Bash setup. The functions
# in this file do not require it, because they are not handling signals, have
# no external calls that can fail (printf as well as date failures are ignored),
# are not using any variables that need to be set, and are not using any pipes.

# This logger implementation can be replaced with another logger implementation
# by placing a script called `logger.bash` in `/usr/local/bin` of the image. The
# only requirement for the script is that it defines the following functions:
#
# - `log.debug`
# - `log.notice`
# - `log.warning`
# - `log.error`
# - `log.success`
#
# Each function **MUST** accept an arbitrary amount of arguments that make up
# the (unstructured) logging message.
#
# Additionally the following environment variables **SHOULD** be supported to
# disable their corresponding log entries, the value of the variables **MUST**
# not matter the mere fact that they are set is all that matters:
#
# - `LOG_DEBUG_DISABLED`
# - `LOG_NOTICE_DISABLED`
# - `LOG_WARNING_DISABLED`
# - `LOG_ERROR_DISABLED`
# - `LOG_SUCCESS_DISABLED`

# The log format is constructed in a way that it can easily be parsed with
# standard tools and simple string manipulations; pattern and example:
#
#     YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.SSS  $level --- $message
#     2022-03-19 10:01:23.172  NOTICE --- example message
#
# This function is an implementation detail and **MUST NOT** be called from
# outside this script (which is possible if the file is sourced).
