# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There's no support, this is a reference implementation.  :-)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open an [issue](https://github.com/some-natalie/kubernoodles/issues/new/choose).  As this is a reference implementation, coordinating in the open means everyone can assess their own risk if it applies to them.
