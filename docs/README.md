# Documentation

All of the documentation that isn't a README for a specific part of the project is linked from here.

## Before you get started

The [admin introduction](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/arch-guide-to-selfhosted-actions/) walks you through some key considerations on _how_ to think about implementing GitHub Actions at the enterprise scale, the implications of those decisions, and why this project is generally built out the way it is.

## Getting up and running

The [admin setup](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/kubernoodles-pt-1/) is a mostly copy-and-paste exercise to get a basic deployment up and going.

The [customization](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/kubernoodles-pt-5/) guide has a quick writeup and links to learn more about the ways you can customize things to your needs.

## Troubleshooting

[Tips and tricks](tips-and-tricks.md) has a few more considerations if things aren't quite going according to plan.
