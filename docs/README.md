# Documentation

All of the documentation that isn't a README for a specific part of the project lives here. :)

## Before you get started

The [admin introduction](admin-introduction.md) walks you through some key considerations on _how_ to think about implementing GitHub Actions at the enterprise scale, the implications of those decisions, and why this project is generally built out the way it is.

## Getting up and running

The [admin setup](admin-setup.md) is a mostly copy-and-paste exercise to get a basic deployment up and going.

The [customization](admin-customization.md) guide has a quick writeup and links to learn more about the ways you can customize things to your needs.

## Troubleshooting

[Tips and tricks](tips-and-tricks.md) has a few more considerations if things aren't quite going according to plan.
