# Contributing to Kubernoodles

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

This is a reference architecture used for demonstrating and providing a scaffold to build your own [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller) implementation - how to manage runners, build/customize images, etc.  This means it's designed for you to take a copy to a private location and mess with it however you need to.  **There is no support.**  

Please consider before opening discussions, pull requests, or issues whether it's specific to your implementation or helpful to the community.

## I Have a Question or Contribution

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](docs).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/some-natalie/kubernoodles/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/some-natalie/kubernoodles/discussions) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable one and still need clarification, you can write your question in that issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/some-natalie/kubernoodles/discussions/new/choose).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.
